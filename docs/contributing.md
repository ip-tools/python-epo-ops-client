## Get Started!

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `python-epo-ops-client` for local
development. Before going into the forking process, you should first [install
a development sandbox](sandbox.md).

1.  Fork the `python-epo-ops-client` repository on GitHub and clone your fork.
    ```shell
    git clone git@github.com:[your_name_here]/python-epo-ops-client.git
    cd python-epo-ops-client/
    ```

4.  Create a branch for local development:
    ```shell
    git switch -c <branchname>
    ```
    Now, make your changes within your working tree.

5.  After making changes to the code base, you may want to check that your
    changes pass test and linting procedures, including testing other Python
    versions with tox. In order to run tox successfully, you must have all versions
    of Python installed on your machine. See `tox -a` for more details.

6.  Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub.

    ```shell
    git add .
    git commit -m "A detailed description of your changes."
    git push origin <branchname>
    ```

7.  Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

## Pull Request Guidelines

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1.  The pull request should include tests.
2.  If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put your
    new functionality into a function with a docstring, and add the feature to
    the list in README.md.
